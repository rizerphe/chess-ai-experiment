## Motivation

The chess-ai-experiment project was inspired by a friendly competition between me and [a friend](https://github.com/rhusiev) to quickly develop a chess AI. The motivation behind this project was primarily for fun and to alleviate boredom during school. This is just the dump of the current state of the project's directory, minus my friend's code - I wanted to put it out there.

## Usage

Currently, the project is not designed to be user-friendly. I might clean the code up and modify for easier usage at some point, no promises though.

## Documentation

At present, no documentation or tutorials are available for this project.
